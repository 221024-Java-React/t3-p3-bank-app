### To start the Vite Project
Install dependencies with ```npm i```
Start the application with ```npm run dev```

### Developer Workflow
  1. Create a ```branch``` using the format ```git checkout -b <firstName-lastName>```
  2. Work only on that branch.
  3. To push, push to your branch using ```git push -u origin <branch-name>```

#### Notes
Currently all merges to main require a pull request and that pull request has to be reviewed/approved by two other people on the devs team before it can be merged. If you make a pull request while you have a previous pull request pending, the most recent PR (when approved and merged) will absorb the previous PR. If conversations are opened on a particular PR they must be resolved before that PR can be merged into main.
